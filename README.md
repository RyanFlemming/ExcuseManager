# ExcuseManager
Tracking progress of project from Head First C#, 3rd Ed.
This project is from Chapter 9 of the book and involves writing a simple program to read and persist data from text files, and dispose of unused resources when finished.
In the future, I will be updating this to make objects Serializable.
